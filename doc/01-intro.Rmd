# Introduction

The Sberbank Kaggle competition consists in predicting the price of houses in a
given period of time (from 2015-07-01 to 2016-05-30). Predictors can be roughly
categorized into apartment/building specific, raion (area or district)
specific, population/demographic data, and macro-economic indicators. There are
more than 290 predictors overall, many of which stronly correlated. One
important characteristic of this dataset is the large number of missing values,
that occurr in non-random patterns. For some predictors more than 40% of the
values are missing, and imputation has little change of succeeding, since all
the values are missing within the same time interval.
